# Full Stack JavaScript Techdegree - Project 1

## Build a random quote generator with vanilla JavaScript

#

- Create a function `getRandomQuote` that returns a random index of the `quotes` array.
- `quotes` array is an array of objects. Quote objects include:
  - quote: `{ string }` - quote
  - source: `{ string }` - name
  - citation: `{ string }` - location
  - year: `{ string }` - year of quote
  - tags: `{ array }` - array of strings

#

- Create a `printQuote` function that prints the random quote and its properties to the page.

#

✔️ Array of objects is named quotes.

✔️ The quotes array contains at least 5 quote objects.

✔️ JavaScript is free of errors that prevent the code from running.

✔️ All objects have quote and source properties.

✔️ At least one object has citation property.

✔️ At least one object has year property.

✔️ A function named getRandomQuote was created.

✔️ The getRandomQuote function returns a random object from the quotes array.

✔️ A function named printQuote was created.

✔️ The printQuote function calls the getRandomQuote function.

✔️ The printQuote function prints a quote and a source property with every quote.

✔️ The printQuote function prints a citation property with at least one quote.

✔️ The printQuote function prints a year property with at least one quote.

✔️ Printed quotes match the format, layout and styles of the example quote in the index.html file.

✔️ Additional code comments have been added.

#

⭐ At least one object has at least one additional property, such as tags.

⭐ At least one additional property prints to the page with the its quote.

⭐ Quotes automatically refresh at regular intervals.

⭐ Background color changes to a random color each time the quote refreshes.
